Session 154 -  Entity Framework Part 1

*********************************************

Whta is Entity Framework : 

- In ASP.NET we use ADO.NET but we cant use in MVC (because enterprise application are too big and complex to implement with ADO.NET)

- suppose we have three columns in Emp table(id,name.salary) because insert query will insert only individual data only not bulk data (100 colums) [Using ADO.NET]

- It can be acheived only entity framework

**********************************

Entity Framework in ASP.NET Core:

- It is an ORM which is type of tool and simplifies mapping objects in software and columns of relational database.

What is ORM (Object Relational Mapper[->]{Mapping between Object & DB Tables(Relational)})

- The ORM Takes care of creating database connections and executing commands as well as executing query results and automatically those results as your application objects.

- ORM helps to keep track of changes to those objects (using "add-migration migrationName") and when instructed it will also persist those changes back to the database (usning "update-database")

- It also increase developers productivity by reducing reduntant task of persisting data used in the applications.

******************************************************

For adding new columns in existing object (Model name eg : Emp)

There are two commands:

1) add-migration migrationName
- It is used to detect the changes from the model


2) update-database 
- It will save the changes in the table
